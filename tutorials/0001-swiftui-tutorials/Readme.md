## Chapter 1. SwiftUI Essentials:

Learn how to use SwiftUI to compose rich views out of simple ones, set up data flow, and build the navigation while watching it unfold in Xcode’s preview.

### 1.1. Creating and combining views

This tutorial guides you through building Landmarks — an app for discovering and sharing the places you love. You’ll start by building the view that shows a landmark’s details.

To lay out the views, Landmarks uses stacks to combine and layer the image and text view components. To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component. As you refine the view’s design, Xcode provides real-time feedback so you can see how those changes translate into code.
